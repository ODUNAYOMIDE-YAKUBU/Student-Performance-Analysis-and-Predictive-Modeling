# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction model

**Project**: Student Performance Analysis And Performance Prediction  
**Author / Maintainer**: Odunayomide Yakubu [Data Scientist and Analyst | Data Storyteller] 


## Overview
This repository contains a reproducible analysis and predictive modeling pipeline for a student performance dataset. The project explores student-level features, performs EDA, preprocesses data, trains machine learning models, and serializes the best model for later use. The primary deliverable is the Jupyter notebook `Student Performance1.ipynb` and a set of helper scripts for reproducibility.

> Goal: improve student academic performance and well-being by identifying key drivers of success and building predictive models to flag at-risk students.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The **Student Performance Dataset** provides insights into academic achievements and extracurricular activities of students. This dataset is valuable for analyzing factors that impact student success, study habits, and parental influence.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
- **Total Records:** 6,055  
- **Total Columns:** 15

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Demographics:** `StudentID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Ethnicity`  
- **Academic Performance:** `GPA`, `GradeClass`, `Absences`, `StudyTimeWeekly`  
- **Parental Influence:** `ParentalEducation`, `ParentalSupport`  
- **Extracurricular Activities:** `ClubInvolvement`, `Sports`, `Music`, `Volunteering`  
- **Additional Support:** `Tutoring`  


## ðŸ—‚ Data dictionary (column descriptions)
> Short, human-readable descriptions for each column â€” update as needed to match your dataset precisely.
- `StudentID` - Student unique identifier (integer)
- `Age` â€” Student age in years (integer).  
- `Gender` â€” Student gender (e.g., `Male`, `Female`, `Other`).  
- `Ethnicity` â€” Self-reported ethnicity or category.  
- `GPA` â€” Grade Point Average (continuous: 0.0 â€“ 4.0 or dataset scale).  
- `GradeClass` â€” Categorical grade bracket (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`) or year group.  
- `Absences` â€” Number of class days missed.  
- `StudyTimeWeekly` â€” Reported weekly study hours.  
- `ParentalEducation` â€” Highest education level of parents/guardians.  
- `ParentalSupport` â€” Indicator of parental support (binary/categorical/scale).  
- `ClubInvolvement` â€” Participation in clubs (Yes/No or list).  
- `Sports` â€” Participation in sports (Yes/No or frequency).  
- `Music` â€” Participation in music programs (Yes/No or frequency).  
- `Volunteering` â€” Volunteering involvement (Yes/No or hours).  
- `Tutoring` â€” Whether student receives tutoring (Yes/No / hours).  
- `EnrollmentStatus` â€” Current enrollment status (e.g., `Active`, `Transferred`, `Dropped`) â€” **(replace if different)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Target variable(s)
Choose target depending on your problem formulation:
- **Regression:** `GPA` (predict continuous performance scores).  
- **Classification:** `GradeClass` (predict grade bucket or `AtRisk` label derived from GPA thresholds).  
- You can also define derived targets such as `AtRisk` (GPA < threshold) or `Improved` (GPA increase vs previous term).

## ðŸ“Š Potential Use Cases
- Predicting student performance based on study habits.  
- Analyzing the impact of extracurricular activities on GPA.  
- Examining the role of parental support in academic success.  
- Identifying trends in absenteeism and its effects on grades.  
- Building an early-warning system to flag at-risk students for intervention.

## ðŸ§° Preprocessing Checklist (recommended)
Before training models, perform these reproducible steps:

1. **Data ingestion** â€” load from `data/student_performance_dataset.csv`.  
2. **Missing values** â€” impute:  
   - Categorical: most frequent or a dedicated `Missing` category.  
   - Numerical: median (robust) or mean where appropriate.  
3. **Type conversions** â€” convert categorical columns to `category` dtype.  
4. **Feature engineering** â€” create derived features (e.g., `StudyTimeCategory`, `AbsenceRate`, `ExtracurricularScore`).  
5. **Encoding** â€” one-hot / ordinal encoding for categorical variables (choose consistent mapping).  
7. **Train/test split** â€” use stratified split for classification; keep a holdout test set (e.g., 20%).  
8. **Imbalanced classes** â€” handle via resampling, class weights, or targeted metrics.  
9. **Versioning** â€” save processed datasets and preprocessing pipeline (e.g., `joblib`).

## ðŸ§ª Modeling & evaluation
Suggested approaches and metrics:

### Model types
- Logistic Regression (classification) .  
-  Random Forest Regression .  

### Evaluation metrics
- **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, RÂ² for `GPA` prediction.  
- **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, .  
- **Business-relevant:** Precision@k, Recall@k, confusion matrix for `AtRisk` detection.

### Model validation
- Cross-validation (k-fold) for robust estimates.  
- Use a holdout test set for final evaluation.  
- Report confidence intervals where possible.

## Notebook summary
`notebooks/Student Performance1.ipynb` contains:
- Data loading & initial inspection (`pandas`, `df.info()`, `df.head()`, `df.nunique()`).
- Exploratory Data Analysis using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (charts and embedded figures).
- Preprocessing and missing-value handling (uses `SimpleImputer`, encoders and `ColumnTransformer`).
- Train/test split and model training with `scikit-learn` (pipelines and model serialization via `joblib`).
- Outputs: plots, summary tables, and saved model artifacts (if run).
